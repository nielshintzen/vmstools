= Mission =

Development of R scripts to setup the workflow of *vms* and *logbooks* data to compute pressure indicators
	


= Details =

a suite of tools written in R for
 
i) analysing and interpreting VMS raw data,

ii) assign a metier level 6 (EU DCF) to each logbook declaration,
 
iii) coupling both information (http://code.google.com/p/vmstools/w/examples_coupling),
 
iv) mapping fishing effort and landings (weight and value) at fine scale resolution, 

v) computing pressure indicators on the marine habitats 

vi) uploading in the fishframe data wharehouse.
