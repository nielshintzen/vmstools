#' Calculate distance between interpolation and reference set
#' 
#' Calculate for each interpolation the distance at fixed points, depending on
#' the number of points present in the reference set, between the interpolated
#' trajectory and the reference trajectory. This indicates the deviation of the
#' interpolated set to the reference set.
#' 
#' Each interpolation has a start and end point which are similar to the start
#' and end point of the reference set. In between these two points, the
#' reference set can have more in-between points which are not used for
#' interpolation, depending on the interval chosen in the 'interpolateVMS'
#' function. These points are matched up with the points on the interpolated
#' track. For each of these reference in-between points, it is calculated which
#' fraction of the total distance was travelled. The same fraction is applied
#' to the interpolated track, and the point that matches with this distance is
#' linked to the reference set point. The distance function is used to
#' calculate the distance between the reference and interpolated dataset.
#' 
#' The mean, logmean, standard deviation, sdlog and total sum of these
#' distances is returned as a matrix.
